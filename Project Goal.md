Goal: The goal is to create an automated deployment solution for the mezbauddin.com website, which will make it easier to deploy, manage, and scale the website.

- Workflow Overview:

Infrastructure Provisioning:
Use Terraform, a tool that helps set up and manage infrastructure resources like servers and networks.
Define the infrastructure requirements in a code-like format, which allows us to easily recreate the same infrastructure in the future.

Container Orchestration:
Use Kubernetes, a powerful tool that helps manage and scale containerized applications.
Deploy the website's application components as containers on a Kubernetes cluster.
Kubernetes takes care of distributing the workload across multiple containers and ensuring high availability.

Configuration Management:
Use Ansible, a configuration management tool, to automate the setup and configuration of the infrastructure and application.
Ansible allows us to define the desired state of the system and automatically make the necessary changes to achieve that state.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which is a workflow automation tool integrated with the GitHub repository.
Whenever developers make changes to the code and push it to the repository, GitHub Actions automatically triggers a series of actions.
These actions include building the application, running tests to ensure its quality, and deploying it to staging and production environments.

Monitoring and Metrics:
Integrate Prometheus, a monitoring system, to collect metrics about the website's performance and health.
Prometheus periodically collects data from various components of the website and stores it for analysis.
Use Grafana, a visualization tool, to create meaningful graphs and dashboards based on the collected metrics, allowing us to monitor the website's performance easily.

High Availability and Scalability:
Design the infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster in a way that ensures the website is highly available and can handle increased traffic.
Implement horizontal scaling, which means that as the demand for the website grows, we can automatically add more resources to handle the load.

- Workflow:

Developers work on the code locally and use Git, a version control system, to manage changes and collaborate.
When developers are ready, they push their changes to the GitHub repository.
GitHub Actions detects the changes and triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
The pipeline performs tasks like building the application, running tests, and deploying it to a staging environment.
In the staging environment, the website undergoes further testing and validation.
If the website passes all tests and is approved, the pipeline deploys it to the production environment.
Prometheus continuously collects metrics about the website's performance, and Grafana provides visualizations and alerts based on those metrics.
The website remains highly available and scalable, ensuring a smooth user experience even during periods of high traffic.
